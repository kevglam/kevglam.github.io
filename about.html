    Designing visuals that draw out deep human emotion and make what may seem invisible (emotions) into something tangible. That is something I constantly seek out to do with design. As a designer and a human, I believe design is important because it allows us to take heart and translate it into art. Doing so in a sustainable and empathic way allows us to better understand each other’s stories and come together as a community.
<p> </p>
    To achieve this, I want to master as much as I can about design, learn more about the world we live in and the people in it and expose myself to new and different aesthetics. Perhaps then will I be closer to creating art that truly speaks to the soul and best translate my own story as an Asian-Canadian whilst being socially and emotionally aware.

Hey! Nice to meet you! My name is Kevin G Lam <span id="chineseletters">(林德江)</span>! I am a graphic designer born and based in Montreal, Canada. I’m constantly searching for new opportunities that will help broaden my visual scope, hone my craft and love for design and grow as a human and designer.  I also enjoy cooking and inventing new recipes, working out, watching anime/cartoons, writing poetry and gaming.
<p> </p>
Whether it is to talk about design, potential jobs and projects or just to brainstorm about which herbs would work best in a recipe, I’d love to get to know you better and see what we could cook up together!
