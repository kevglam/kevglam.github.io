  你好！Hello!
  <p></p>
Born in Montreal, Canada 1996; My name is Kevin G Lam (林德江)!

<p></p>

I am a Graphic Designer and Videographer based in Montreal. Graduated from Concordia University in Computation Arts. Being in Computation Arts exposed me to many different mediums such as 3D, Web Design, Graphic Design, Sound, Video, you name it! This made me into the artist I am today and allowed me to experience so many realms in order to figure out what unique space my creativity thrives in. Currently, I primarily work with different aspects of Graphic Design such as visual identity, poster work and other 2D graphics but I also do video work. I am particularly interested in how these two worlds (Graphic Design + Video) come together.

<p></p>
I am Asian Canadian (好嘢! Yay!) and growing up in such an amazing melting pot of culture definitely shines through in my work. I draw from my family culture (A splash of Chinese and Vietnamese), my hometown’s culture (A cup of Canadian) and the pop culture I grew up in (Hints of American, Japanese and Korean). Bake at 425°F for 23 years and voila! You got yourself a Kevin G Lam ready to create and inspire!
