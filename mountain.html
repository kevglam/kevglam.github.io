  <div id="mountdesc01">Mountain is a project that illustrates the Quantified Self in a subjective and emotional way. </div>

  <div id="mountdesc02">
    In the span of 2 weeks, I have tracked data following a workout at the gym. After every workout I would sketch a shape of a mountain as well as collect data of the current day. Each mountain represents my confidence levels and ego after a workout. The art piece is based on a subjective question I will be asking myself after every workout. The question is "How many mountains do you feel like you can lift?" (On a scale out of 7 mountains).
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <div id="mountdesc03">
    My project is an emotional and subjective approach to the quantified self movement. Symbolically, each poster I created represents a mountain that I have conquered. The topographic maps that go with these mountains provide details of the day I conquer each mountain.
    <p> </p>
    Mountain consists of a series of seven 13x19 Posters and seven 6x6 Topographic Maps. Maps includes data collected during the workout day. The "tangible" data that I have collected includes the date, weather and time. The maps and posters also include more subjective data such as the drawn shape of the mountain, the keyword associated to the day and the given color. Additionally, each map includes a "Highest Point". The numbers associated to this point is the total amount of pounds (lbs) I have lifted during the workout.
